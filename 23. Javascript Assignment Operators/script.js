Assignment operator

let xyz = 10;

// =,  +=, -=, *=, /=, %=; **=,

let b = 6;
b += 3; //x = x + 3;
console.log(b)

let y = 1;
y -= 4; //y = y - 4;
console.log(y);


let z = 2;
z *= 6; //z = z * 6;
console.log(z);

let x = 20;
x /= 4; // x is now 5 (equivalent to x = x / 4)

let m = 10;
m %= 3; // m is now 1 (equivalent to x = x % 3)

let k = 2;
k **= 3; // k is now 8 (equivalent to x = x ** 3)
